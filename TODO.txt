Implement armor shredding

Support increased charge damage

Additional boss mechanics:
    Summons turrets in a square around the disc that shoot 6 shot novas
    Charges to the center of the disc and shoots two spirals of bullets with opposite rotations or one slow spiral and one fast spiral

Add rare potion drop from enemies
    Refills life if potions are full
    Grants bonus XP for any wasted life based on enemy level (potionXp is assigned on creation to 0.2 * enemyXP)

Add world map generation
    world is infinite in the up and left and right directions
    store cells of 4000px wide sections that always connect left/right
    cell uses dungeon generation but forces connecting sides and optionally top/bottom if SRandom determines there is a connection in either place
    extra disc placed between cells is always there on connection and does not spawn monsters and may contain a fountain to refill life and potions
