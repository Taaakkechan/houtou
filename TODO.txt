Add world map generation
    set level on disc
    world is infinite in the up and left and right directions
    store cells of 4000px wide sections that always connect left/right
    cell uses dungeon generation but forces connecting sides and optionally top/bottom if SRandom determines there is a connection in either place
    extra disc placed between cells is always there on connection and does not spawn monsters and may contain a fountain to refill life and potions
    disc difficulty tiers:
        level 1   +0-1 dungeon level
        level 2-3 +1-2
        level 5-8 +1-2
        level 10-15 +2-3 (+2 aditional levels within dungeons based on dungeon type)
            So for example, a level 14 enemy could drop a level 17 dungeon that has 2 additional floors of level 18 + level 19.
        level 20-25
        level 30-35
        and so on.
    Types of enemies that can appear and dungeons that can drop expand with level of disc
