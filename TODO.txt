Add rare potion drop from enemies
    Refills life if potions are full
    Grants bonus XP for any wasted life based on enemy level (potionXp is assigned on creation to 0.2 * enemyXP)

Add world map generation
    world is infinite in the up and left and right directions
    store cells of 4000px wide sections that always connect left/right
    cell uses dungeon generation but forces connecting sides and optionally top/bottom if SRandom determines there is a connection in either place
    extra disc placed between cells is always there on connection and does not spawn monsters and may contain a fountain to refill life and potions
